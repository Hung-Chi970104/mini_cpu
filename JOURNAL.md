## 10/7/2025 - I began to learn how ALU works using logic gates

Here are the few videos I went through

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA (highly recommended)

I first learned about how different logic gates are built based on one another (AND and NOT)
- NAND uses AND + NOT
- OR uses NAND + NOT
- XOR uses NAND + AND + OR

Later, I learned how to compute sum and carry.

Eventually, I learned how to build a 4-bit adder using all the components above.
