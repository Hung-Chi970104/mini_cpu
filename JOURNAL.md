## 10/7/2025 - I began to learn how ALU works using logic gates

Here are the few videos I went through
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSVhlqE7EgA&list=PLilenfQGj6CEG6iZ4TQJ10PI7pCWsy1AO
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA (highly recommended)

I first learned about how different logic gates are built based on one another (AND and NOT)
- NAND uses AND + NOT
- OR uses NAND + NOT
- XOR uses NAND + AND + OR

Later, I learned how to compute sum and carry.

Eventually, I learned how to build a 4-bit adder using all the components above.

  

## 10/8/2025 - Plan out ALU adder and build logic gates from scratch  

Plan out logic gates used in the adder![553963461_1541435776890153_311232645113121765_n.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d32c6b0386dbac5cd2f56249d9dae18b8dcf1c4e/553963461_1541435776890153_311232645113121765_n.jpg)

Later, I built a NOT gate using a transistor, two resistors, and a switch (circuit diagram + actual circuit)
Challenges:
- Figuring out how the circuit works in the diagram
- Converting the diagram to the breadboard
- Forgot to place resistors in series (accidentally burned an LED)
- Cleaning up the breadboarding to make it look more aesthetic)
