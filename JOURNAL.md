## 10/7/2025 - I began to learn how ALU works using logic gates  

![Screenshot 2025-10-07 011951.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODQ2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--09cfc1aef53af29a26fc079d20eae8a40e8c29b2/Screenshot%202025-10-07%20011951.png)
Here are the few videos I went through
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSVhlqE7EgA&list=PLilenfQGj6CEG6iZ4TQJ10PI7pCWsy1AO
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA (highly recommended)

I first learned about how different logic gates are built based on one another (AND and NOT)
- NAND uses AND + NOT
- OR uses NAND + NOT
- XOR uses NAND + AND + OR

Later, I learned how to compute sum and carry.

Eventually, I learned how to build a 4-bit adder using all the components above.

  

## 10/8/2025 - Plan out ALU adder and build logic gates from scratch  

Plan out logic gates used in the adder![553963461_1541435776890153_311232645113121765_n.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d32c6b0386dbac5cd2f56249d9dae18b8dcf1c4e/553963461_1541435776890153_311232645113121765_n.jpg)

Later, I built a NOT gate using a transistor, two resistors, and a switch (circuit diagram + actual circuit)
Challenges:
- Figuring out how the circuit works in the diagram
- Converting the diagram to the breadboard
- Forgot to place resistors in series (accidentally burned an LED)
- Cleaning up the breadboarding to make it look more aesthetic)

## 10/11/2025 - Built And/Or Gates  

# Goal
I built an And and Or gate, the two fundamental logic gates
![OrAnd.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU3MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a4c2fb751b9f0ca67fd050e05bb6f5450e91229e/OrAnd.jpg)

- Button version (dont know why it's buggy)

# Main Challenge
I spent a lot of time on AND gate because I kept connecting the components to the emitter, which raised the voltage instead of 0V. Later, I went on Youtube and fully understood how transistors work. Eventually, I realized that the base needs to connect to the positive and emitter directly to the ground in order to create the voltage difference between the two.  

## 10/13/2025 - Built NAND/NOR/XOR Gates  

NAND Gate

NOR Gate
![NOR.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f4487cc900160fa5f1d7d08aa98b05d348519ccf/NOR.jpg)

XOR Gate
![XOR.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b87737576b7af6baecbeb9f13aa7c8c50674da89/XOR.jpg)

Study:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uowMENwiHQ (teaches you how transistors work internally)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTu3LwpF6XI&t=1s (teaches you how to build XOR gate)

Challenge:
- Any common-emitter NPN stage needs a load to VCC. If the collector only goes to other transistor collectors/emitters and not to VCC through a resistor (or an active pull-up), it will float. _Always provide a defined output level for every stage_
- Remember to choose resistors wisely and also remember to do at least a rough calculation on the amount of your desired current and voltage
